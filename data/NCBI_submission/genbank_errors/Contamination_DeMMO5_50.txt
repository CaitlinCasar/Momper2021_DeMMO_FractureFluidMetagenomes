[] We ran your sequences through our Contamination Screen. The screen found 
contigs that need to be trimmed and/or excluded. The results are in the 
Contamination.txt file posted in your submission on the WGS submission portal 
https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/genome/.  Please adjust the sequences 
appropriately and then resubmit your sequences. After you remove the 
contamination, trim any Ns at the ends of the sequence and remove any sequences
that are shorter than 200 nt and not part of a multi-component scaffold.

Note that mismatches between the name of the adaptor/primer identified in the screen 
and the sequencing technology used to generate the sequencing data should not be used 
to discount the validity of the screen results as the adaptors/primers of many 
different sequencing platforms share sequence similarity.


Contamination Results:


Adaptor:
[] Some of the sequences hit primers or adaptors used in Illumina or 
454 or other sequencing strategies or platforms.  Adaptor at the 
end of a sequence should be removed. However, if adaptors are 
present within sequences then you should strongly consider 
splitting the sequences at the adaptors because the adaptor sequence 
could have been the region of overlap, causing a misassembly.
